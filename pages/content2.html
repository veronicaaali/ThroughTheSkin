        <p>A year after my younger brother was born, I went to get a tattoo. This little guy might just be my angel.</p>
        <p>At first, my parents didn’t understand and said I was being “rebellious” or “non-mainstream.” But after I explained the meaning behind the tattoo, they fell silent.</p>
        <p>At that time, I was dealing with mild depression and severe insomnia. The hospital diagnosed me with neurasthenia. Most of the time, my face showed no expression at all. It was my little brother who slowly made me feel the wonder of life again. He made me feel warmth and helped me smile again. To put it simply, this little one helped me out of depression.</p>
        <p>So I got this tattoo: three large triangles — representing my mom and dad protecting me — and in the middle, a small triangle representing my parents and me, protecting my little brother. I want to grow up alongside him, together with my mom and dad.</p>
