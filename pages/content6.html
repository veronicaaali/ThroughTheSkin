        <p>I finally decided to get this Möbius strip tattoo after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was caught in a terrifying cycle of depression and mania, along with insomnia, vomiting, rashes… and heartbreak.</p>
        <p>Every single day felt unbearably painful — the same endless loop with no way out. Just like a Möbius strip.</p>
        <p>One day, I suddenly realized that this cycle is a part of me, and I can’t separate myself from it. So I got this tattoo.</p>
        <p>(Later, some people asked me, “Why did you get such a big number 8 tattooed?” I would just smile and say, “Because I feel like it!” :) )</p>

        <p>I got this tattoo half a month ago, on my ribcage — the word worthy.</p>
        <p>Half a month ago, I suddenly had the idea to get a tattoo. I had been struggling with low self-esteem for years, and I wanted to tattoo worthy to remind myself that I deserve better.</p>
        <p>Out of respect for my parents, I told them in advance. My dad said, “If you get a tattoo, get out of this house.” That night, he hit me — not too seriously, but still.</p>
        <p>What really left me feeling hopeless, though, was the conversation I had with my mom afterward. She asked me, “You hate your dad just because he hit you once? If your husband hits you in the future, are you going to get a divorce? What if you have kids? How could you get divorced then? Who gets married and then divorces — how embarrassing would that be?”</p>
        <p>I didn’t know how to answer those questions. I didn’t want to answer. I just wanted to leave.</p>
        <p>On the third day, I moved out. And I had worthy tattooed on my ribcage.</p>
        <p>Family has such a huge impact on a person. That deep sense of unworthiness still clings to me, and in relationships, I often find it hard to let go and end up compromising too much.</p>
        <p>After moving out, I’ve been trying to heal — slowly rebuilding my confidence and making amends for the mistakes I’ve made.</p>
        <p>A tattoo is something that stays with you for life. Having it on my body is a constant reminder: never forget to be kind to myself. I deserve all good things.</p>

        <p>I majored in law, and the scales of justice represent my dream of becoming a lawyer. I got this tattoo before taking my second attempt at the graduate school entrance exam.</p>
        <p>My undergraduate years were not happy — I was lonely, depressed, and completely lost in my studies, wasting a lot of time. When I decided to get the tattoo, the pain of the process made me feel like my life had a chance to start over. It also became a reminder that I have suffered for the ideals of fairness and justice.</p>
        <p>Now, I’ve been admitted to the top law school!</p>
