        <p>I got this tattoo when I was in high school. It’s the birthdates of my mom, my sister, and me.</p>
        <p>From childhood to growing up, we lived under the shadow of my father’s violence. During my high school years, our family situation became unbearable, and we finally left him.</p>
        <p>At that time, I felt that from then on, it would just be the three of us — my mom, my sister, and me — starting a new life together, relying on each other.</p>
        <p>So I tattooed our three birthdates on my arm to mark that moment.</p>
