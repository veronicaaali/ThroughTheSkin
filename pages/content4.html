        <p>At the end of 2016, I decided to get a tattoo. The reason behind it was that in May 2016, I quit my job in the CBD of a second-tier city and went to the Yunnan border to open a guesthouse.</p>
        <p>The meaning behind this piece of text is:
          "Heaven and hell are just one thought apart; every decision in life is the same."</p>
        <p>I never thought of getting a tattoo or opening a guesthouse as something “cool.” Rather, it was meant to be a reminder to myself — to truly understand and accept the pain and challenges that come with the choices I make.</p>
